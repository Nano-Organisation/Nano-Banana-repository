// This file is intentionally neutralized to resolve a case-sensitivity collision with App.tsx.
// On many file systems, App.tsx and app.tsx cannot coexist without causing compiler ambiguity.
// The application logic has been standardized in the capitalized App.tsx, and the entry point
// index.tsx has been updated to import that version exclusively.
